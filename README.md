# ADET-Compilations

To set up the landing page locally, begin by cloning the ADET-Compilations repository to your computer. Once downloaded, navigate to your XAMPP installation directory and locate the htdocs folder (typically found at C:\xampp\htdocs on Windows or /Applications/XAMPP/htdocs on macOS). Move the entire ADET-Compilations folder into the htdocs directory. Next, launch XAMPP and start the Apache server from the XAMPP Control Panel. Open your web browser and type [[http://localhost/ADET-Compilations/index.html](https://breyjohn.github.io/ADET-Compilations/)](https://breyjohn.github.io/ADET-Compilations/) in the address bar, then press Enter. You should now see the landing page displayed, showcasing its styled content, features, and a call-to-action button for the associated To-do App.
